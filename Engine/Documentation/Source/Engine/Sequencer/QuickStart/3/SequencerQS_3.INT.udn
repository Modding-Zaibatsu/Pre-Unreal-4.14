In the previous step, we added a camera and provided a path for our camera to take. In this step, we replace the Character Blueprint that is used with the template with a **Skeletal Mesh** Actor that we can apply animations to, completing our first shot.

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, navigate to the **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh** folder and click on **SK_Mannequin**.

1.	**Left-click** and drag the end of the **ThirdPersonIdle** animation so it loops and fills the entire 150 frames.
