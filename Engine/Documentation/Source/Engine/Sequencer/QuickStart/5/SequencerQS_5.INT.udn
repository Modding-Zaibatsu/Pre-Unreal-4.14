In the previous steps, we created our shots. Now, we tie them together using the **Shot Track** which enables you to add Level Sequences along the timeline for playback. We also create a **Take** of one of those Shots, which enables us to create a variant of that shot or use it as an additional Shot in the cinematic. 

At the end of this step, you will have your own multi-shot cinematic! 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, open the **Master** Level Sequence.

1. Inside the Level Sequence, click the **Add** button and select the **Shot Track**.

1. Click the **+ Shot** button and add **Shot01** to the track. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_3.png)

1. Add **Shot02** to the **Shot Track**. Notice that Shot02 extends past the red maker (which is the end of playback range). Drag the red marker to the end of Shot02 or automatically keep added sections within playback range by enabling the option in the **General Options** menu.

1. Click the **General Options** button and select **Keep Playback Range in Section Bounds**. This pushes the end marker out for us anytime we add content and will ensure that everything is within playback range.

1. **Left-click** and drag **Shot02** down a level within the **Shot Track**.

	[REGION:tip]
	You can drag shots around to arrange the playback order or for organization purposes. A typical best practice is to alternate between tracks within a Shot Track to illustrate where cuts occur rather than leaving them all on the same single track.

	Below, we have the same number of shots without using an adddtional Track within the Shots Track.

1. Click the **Lock Viewport** toggle button to lock the camera to the **Shot Track**. Like the **Camera Cuts** Camera Lock button, the Shot Track will only affect the Cinematic Viewport.

	![](SequencerQS_5_7.png) 

1. **Right-click** on **Shot02** and select the **New Take** option. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_8.png)

1. A **Duplicate Asset As** window will appear, click **Save**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_9.png)

	[REGION:note]
	Takes are automatically named. You can change the naming convention in the [](Engine/UI/ProjectSettings) under **Level Sequences**.  
	[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** on the newly created Shot and choose **New Take** again. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_10.png)

	[REGION:note]
	When creating a Take, it does not delete the Level Sequence but creates a duplicate of it which you can then alter. Currently, when creating a Take for the first time, it replaces the Shot with the new Take (the original Shot still exists in the Content Browser but is not listed as a "Take" in the Takes Menu - see below). 
	[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** on the newly created shot and highlight **Takes**. We are currently using **Take 3** in our cinematic. We can switch to Take 2 by select it from this menu. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_11.png)

1.	**Double-click** on the **Shot0002_003** to open it. **Left-click** drag to select and delete each of the keyframes within it. We are going to change the current camera movement to a different motion for this take. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_12.png)

1.	Lock the Viewport to the camera. Move it near the character's face and press **S** to keyframe the position. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_14.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the camera, adjust the **Manual Focus Distance** and add a keyframe for the adjusted value. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_15.png)

1.	Jump to the end of the sequence. Move the camera back away from the character and keyframe it. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_16.png)

1.	Click the **Master** breadcrumb to return to the **Master** Track.

## End Result

You now have a two shot cinematic, however you can use different **Takes** from the Take Menu.

You can re-arrange the Shots by dragging them to new locations on the Shot Track or add a Take as an additional Shot, giving you three Shots. While this is only a small fraction of what is possible with Sequencer, it highlights some of the core aspects of the tool that you can use to craft your scenes. 

In the next and final step, there are some "On Your Own" challenges you can attempt to add to this scene and links to additional documentation.
