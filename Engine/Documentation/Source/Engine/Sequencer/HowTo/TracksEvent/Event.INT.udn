The **Event Track** can be used to call [**Custom Events**](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Events/Custom) and fire off [**Blueprint Script**](Engine/Blueprints) inside the  [**Level Blueprint**](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/LevelBlueprint). 
Once the Custom Event is called, any script attached to it will also be executed and can be used for any number of scenarios based on your needs. 

In this example, we will execute an Event which will be used to activate a particle effect in the level. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	From the **Main Toolbar** click the **Cinematics** button and **Add Level Sequence**.

	Choose a Save Location and give the Level Sequence a name when prompted. 

1.	In Sequencer, click the **Add** button and select to add an **Event Track**.

1.	On the **Event Track**, move the Timeline Marker to **75** then click the **+** sign to add a key.

1.	**Right-click** on the key, then under **Properties** enter the name **MyEvent** for the **Value**. 

	![](EventTrack4.png)

	The name you provide here is the name you **must** use when creating your **Custom Event** that you want to call. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **StarterContent/Particles**, drag the **P_Explosion** into the level.

1.	With the **P_Explosion** asset selected, in the **Details** panel un-check the **Auto Activate** option. 

	![](EventTrack6.png)

	This will ensure that the particle effect is not played upon starting the level. 

1.	With the **P_Explosion** asset still selected, click the **Blueprints** button from the Toolbar and select **Open Level Blueprint**.

1.	In the **Level Blueprint**, **Right-click** and select **Create a Reference to P_Explosion**. 

	![](EventTrack8.png)

1.	**Right-click** in the graph again and search for and add a **Custom Event** node and name it **MyEvent** (the same as in **Step 4**).

	[REGION:note]
	This must be the text you entered as the value in Step 4. You can press the **F2** key on the node to rename it. 
	[/REGION]

1.	**Left-click** drag off the **P_Explosion** node and search for and add the **Activate (ParticleSystemComponent)** node. 

	![](EventTrack10.png)

1.	Connect the **Custom Event** to the **Activate** node as shown below. 

	![](EventTrack11.png)

	When the event is called it will activate (turn on) the particle effect we placed in the level.

1.	In the Main Editor window from the **World Outliner** select your Level Sequence then in the **Details** enable **Auto Play**. 

	![](EventTrack12.png)

	When we play in the level, this Level Sequence will automatically play and trigger our effect. 

1.	Click the **Play** button from the Main Toolbar to play in the editor. 


## End Result

When playing in the editor after a few seconds, the explosion will activate.

In the video above, we also illustrate that you will not see the script being executed when you click the **Play** button inside Sequencer.
You will only be able to preview your scripted events being called from your Event Track during gameplay when the Level Sequence is played.
