[REGION:warning]
This is a feature that is currently undergoing development and may not work as expected or may change in future revisions.
[/REGION]

The **Level Sequence** Editor (or **Sequencer** for short) is still in the early stages of development and must be enabled in order to access it. 
This guide will show you where you can access and enable Sequencer (as well as the **Sequence Recorder**) and open up the Sequencer Editor so that you can begin creating cinematics. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project. However, you can use any project you wish. 
[/REGION]

1.	With your project open select **Edit** from the **File** Menu, then select **Plugins**.

	You will need to click **Okay** at the confirmations as well as **Restart** the Editor for the changes to be applied. 

1.	After restarting the Editor, inside your project from the **Toolbar** click **Cinematics** then **Add Level Sequence**.

After choosing a name and save location for your Level Sequence, the **Sequencer** Editor will automatically open.

Inside the Sequencer Editor you can start adding different types of **Tracks** which you can use to craft your cinematic sequences. 
You can also use the [**Sequence Recorder**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\SequenceRecorder\) to record content that will be used to automatically create new Level Sequences which you can edit inside Sequencer. 

To open the Sequence Recorder window, from the **Window** option of the Menu Bar select **Sequence Recorder**.

The **Sequence Recorder** window will open.

[REGION:note]
The Sequence Recorder is enabled by default, however you will not be able to edit the Level Sequence it creates unless you have enabled the **Level Sequence Editor**.
