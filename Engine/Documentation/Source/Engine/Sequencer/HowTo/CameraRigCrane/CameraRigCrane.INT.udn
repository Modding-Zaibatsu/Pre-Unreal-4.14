One of the tools real-world filmmakers use to produce smooth sweeping shots is by attaching a camera to a crane and controlling the shot through the crane's movement.
You can create similar shots in Sequencer with the use of the **Camera Rig Crane** Actor and an attached **Camera**. 

In this how-to we will add a Camera Rig Crane, attach a Camera, and create a sample Crane Shot. 


## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	In your project on the **Modes** panel under **Cinematic**, drag a **Camera Rig Crane** asset into the level.

1.	Also under **Cinematic**, drag a **Cine Camera Actor** into the level. 

	![](Crane02.png)

1.	In the **World Outliner** window, drag-and-drop the **CineCameraActor** onto the **CameraRig_Crane**. 

	![](Crane03.png)

	This will attach the camera to the crane so that it will follow the crane's movement. 

1.	Select the **CineCameraActor**, then in the **Details** panel under **Transform** enter "0" for **Location** and **Rotation** values. 

	![](Crane04.png)

	This will zero out the camera's transform and attach it correctly to the crane. 

1.	From the Main Toolbar, click **Cinematics** then select **Add Level Sequence**. 

	![](Crane05.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and select both the **CameraRigCrane** and **CineCameraActor**, then add both to **Sequencer**. 

	![](Crane06.png)

1.	Click **Add** then select the **Camera Cut Track**. 

	![](Crane07.png)

	This will allow us to define which camera to shoot this Level Sequence from. 

1.	On the **Camera Cuts** track, click the **+ Camera** button then select the **CineCameraActor**. 

	![](Crane08.png)

	We are now ready to shoot our scene using our Camera Rig Crane and Cine Camera Actor. 
	You can preview what the scene will look like through the perspective of the camera we added by clicking the **Lock Viewport to Camera** button on the **Camera Cuts Track**. 

	![](Crane09.png)

	Clicking **Lock Viewport to Camera** again will unlock the camera. 	

1.	Using the **Translate** tool (**W** key) and **Rotation** tool (**E** key), rotate the crane/camera as shown below. 

	![](Crane10.png)

	We are going to raise the crane and push it out to focus and reveal the character standing in the level for this particular shot. 

1.	Add a key for the **Transform** location of the **Cine Camera Actor** by clicking the **Add Key** button on the **Transform Track**. 

	![](Crane11.png)

1.	Click the **+ Track** button on the **CameraRig_Crane** and add the **Crane Arm Length**, **Crane Pitch** and **Crane Yaw** tracks. 

	![](Crane12.png)

1.	Scrub the Timeline Marker ahead to **50** then set **Crane Arm Length** to **1000** and **Crane Pitch** to **20** and add keys for both. 

	![](Crane13.png)

	If you scrub back-and-forth between the start and frame 50 you should see the crane movement in the viewport.

1.	Scrub the Timeline Marker to the end of the Sequence (**150**).

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **CameraRig_Crane**, set **Crane Yaw** to **-25** and add a key. 

	![](Crane14.png)

	You can set the **Crane Pitch**, **Crane Yaw** and **Crane Arm Length** from the **Details** panel by clicking the **Add Key** button next to each property. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **CineCameraActor**, set the **XYZ** values for **Rotation** to **0, -25, -50**. 

	![](Crane16.png)

	The values may not be exact and might be auto adjusted which is fine. 

1.	With the **Cine Camera Actor** still selected, press **Shift + E** to add a key for the rotational values. 

	![](Crane17.png)

1.	Lock the viewport to the **Camera Cuts** track then click the **Preview Play** button. 

	
## End Result

You should have something similar to below where the camera pans up along with the crane and pushes in towards the character.

You can adjust the keys by dragging them to new values in the Tracks Area. Above we slowed the cranes upward movement by moving the **Crane Arm Length** and **Crane Pitch** keyframes we added at frame **50** and moved them to frame **100**. 

[REGION:tip]
There is an advanced method you can use to work with the **Camera Rig Crane** asset in Sequencer that will automate several of the steps from this how-to. Please see the [**Workflow Shortcuts**](Engine\Sequencer\Workflow\CheatSheet) section for more information.
