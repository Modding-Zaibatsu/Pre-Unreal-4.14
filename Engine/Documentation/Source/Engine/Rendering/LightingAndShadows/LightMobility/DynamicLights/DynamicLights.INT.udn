[EXCERPT:Movable001]

**Movable Lights** cast completely dynamic light and shadows, can change position, rotation, color, brightness, falloff, radius, and just about every other property they have. None of the light they cast gets baked into the light maps, and currently they cannot have any indirect lighting.

[/EXCERPT:Movable001]

## Shadowing

Movable lights setup to cast shadows use whole scene dynamic shadows, which have a significant performance cost.  The performance cost comes primarily from the number of meshes affected by the light, and the triangle count of those meshes.  This means that a shadow casting movable light with a large radius will cost many times more than a movable light with a small radius.

## Usage

On any light, under the **Transform** category, you will find a pull down property called **Mobility**; change that to **Movable**. This property also appears on light components added to a Blueprint.

## Shadow Map Caching 

When a point or spot light is not moving, we can store off the shadow map for that light and reuse it next frame. This makes shadow casting movable Point and Spot lights much more affordable in games where the environment is often not moving. In the following document we will take a look at how you can use this feature in your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) projects.

## Enabling Shadow Map Caching 
Shadow Map Caching should be automatically be enabled in your UE4 project. To check and see if Shadow Map Caching is enabled you can do the following:

1. Select all of the lights in your project's level that you want to cast dynamic shadows.

1. Set the lights **Mobility**  to **Movable** and make sure that **Cast Shadows** is enabled.

1. Press the **Backtick (`)** key to open up the Unreal Console and type **Stat Shadowrendering** to see the current cost of dynamic shadows.

1. Press the Backtick (`) key again to open the Console and type **r.Shadow.CacheWholeSceneShadows 0** to disable dynamic shadow caching.

	[region:note]
	 Make sure to note the the numbers in the **CallCount** and **InclusiveAug** sections.
	[/region]

1. Now press the Backtick (`) key one more time to open the Console and type **r.Shadow.CacheWholeSceneShadows 1** to re-enable shadow caching. If you compare the Callout and InclusiveAug numbers you can see the impact this feature has on dynamic shadow performance.

## Performance
The impact that this features has on performance is quite significant. Here are the results of testing this feature using an NVIDIA 970 GTX GPU at a screen resolution of 1920x1200.

* Before enabling this feature three shadow casting point lights without caching took 14.89ms to render Shadow Depths.

* When Cached Shadow Maps where enabled the same three shadow casting lights took .9ms to render which is about **16 times faster**!
	[region:note]
	Note that it still costs 2 ms to render the contributions of the 33 point lights, which can be optimized in other ways but is not affected by this change.
	[/region]
* You can control the maximum amount memory used by the Shadow Map Cache using **r.Shadow.WholeSceneShadowCacheMb**

## Limitations
While enabling Shadow Map Caching can decrease the cost of using dynamic shadows in your UE4 projects, there are some limitations that could cause rendering artifacts if used with non-supported features. In the following section we will take a look at what the limitations of Shadow Map Casting are and what you can do about them.


* By default, caching can only happen when an object meets the following requirements:

	* Primitives have mobility their **Mobility** set to **Static** or **Stationary**. 
	* Materials used in the level do not use **World Position Offset**.
	* Light need to be either a **Point** or **Spot** light, have its **Mobility** set to **Movable** and have **Shadow Casting** enabled.
	* Lights have to remain stationary and can not move at all.
	* Materials that use animated **Tessellation** or **Pixel Depth Offset** can cause artifacts as their shadow depths are cached.
