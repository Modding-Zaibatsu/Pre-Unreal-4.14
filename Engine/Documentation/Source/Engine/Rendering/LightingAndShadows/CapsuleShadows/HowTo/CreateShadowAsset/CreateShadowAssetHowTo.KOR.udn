In order to have Capsule Shadow representations a Physics Asset that will be used for soft shadowing must be created that is unique to your Skeletal Mesh Actor. 
Since this Physics Asset is not used for any physics simulations it does not have to accurately match the Skeletal Mesh. Follow the steps below to create a Shadow 
Physics Asset for your Skeletal Mesh.


## Steps

1. Inside the **Content Browser**, find and select your character **Skeletal Mesh**. 

	[REGION:note]
	If you do not have a Skeletal Mesh to use, you can enable **Show Engine Content** under the **View Options** selection in the **Content Browser.** Then navigate to
	**Engine Content** > **Tutorial** > **SubEditors** > **TutorialAssets** > **Character** folder and copy the **TutorialTPP** Skeletal Mesh to your own folder under **Content**.
	[/REGION]

2. Right-Click on the **TutorialTPP** Skeletal Mesh to open the context menu and select **Create**, then select **Physics Asset**.

3. A **New Asset** window will open. Set the **Minimum Bone Size** to **15** and click **Ok**.

	[REGION:note]
	Only use **Sphyl** bodies for the best results. **Sphere** bodies will work, but are not as flexible.
	[/REGION]

4. At this point, the **Physics Asset Tool** (PhAT) will open. Before moving forward, minimize the **PhAT** window and go back to the **Content Browser** and rename the newly created Physics asset from **TutorialTPP_Physics** to something
like **CS_TutorialTPP**, or anything that is recognizable for you.

5. Now **maximize** the **PhAT** editor window to view the Physics Asset that has been created. You should see something similar to this.

6. Adjust the **Physics Bodies** so that the capsules represent the body of your Character more accurately. There are several things to consider when adjusting the capsules for your character listed below. 

	* Remove any unnecessary capsules, like hands, multiple bodies for the torso, and neck.
	* Foot capsules are the most important to make the character look grounded.
	* Use a little bit of overlap of the capsules between joints.
	* Capsules for the arms are not necessary unless you're character will be near surfaces like with cover systems or if the character can go prone.
	
	[REGION:tip]
	In the **PhAT Editor Main Viewport** set the **Collision Render Mode** to **Solid** to make it easier to see the adjustments you make to the Sphyl bodies for your Skeletal Mesh.

	[INCLUDE:#imagetable]
	[/REGION]
	
	[REGION:note]
	The shadow casting in the PhAT editor is not representative of the shadows that will be cast from the capsule bodies. You must test them in your scene.
	[/REGION]
	
	For more information on how to use the [Physics Asset Tool](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Physics/PhAT/HowTo/index.html) see the following page.

7. When you are finished with your adjustments you should have something that looks similiar to this. Depending on the Skeletal Mesh you used the results may have something different.
