## Application Lifecycle Component

The **ApplicationLifecycleComponent** handles receiving notifications from the OS about application state (activated, suspended, termination, etc). 

## Child Actor Component

A **ChildActorComponent** is a Component that spawns an Actor when registered, and destroys it when unregistered. 

## Scene Component

The **SceneComponent** has a transform and supports attachment, but has no rendering or collision capabilities. This is useful as a "dummy" Component in the hierarchy to offset others.
