This page outlines the currently supported file extensions and URLs as well as outlines some troubleshooting tips on how to enable Media Framework with different platforms. 
There are some known platform specific issues and limitations which we are currently investigating and trying to resolve, each of which have been identified in the Troubleshooting Platform sections.

## Troubleshooting

Most player plug-ins will provide detailed logging of potential problems. To enable this, add the following to your projects **Engine.ini** file: 

	[Core.Log]
	LogMedia=Verbose
	LogMediaAssets=Verbose
	LogAndroidMedia=Verbose
	LogAvfMedia=Verbose
	LogMfMedia=Verbose
	LogPS4Media=Verbose
	LogWmfMedia=Verbose

If a media source fails to open or play, check the **Output Log** under the [Developer Tools](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Tools/DevTools/) for additional details.

You can also check information about a Media Source inside the Media Player asset and **Info** tab.

If **Verbose Logging** is enabled for the Media Assets log category, this information is also added to the Output Log. 

### PlayStation 4

The PS4Media player plug-in is disabled by default and must be enabled in the project�s [Plugin Settings](Programming/Plugins/).

The video decoder on PS4 consumes a lot of Onion memory, especially with HLS. You may run out of memory when trying to play more than one video at the same time, because we allocate only 200 MB by default. 
Currently, these default settings are not exposed in the UI but you can modify them by hand.

To enable, add the following to the **PS4Engine.ini**: 

	[SystemSettings]
	r.GarlicHeapSizeMB=2600
	r.OnionHeapSizeMB=200

In your game's ** *.Target.cs**:

	public override void SetupGlobalEnvironment(
            	TargetInfo Target,
            	ref LinkEnvironmentConfiguration OutLinkEnvironmentConfiguration,
            	ref CPPEnvironmentConfiguration OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration)
	{
            	// ...

            	if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.PS4)
            	{
	OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration.Definitions
	.Add("GARLIC_HEAP_SIZE= (2900ULL * 1024 * 1024)");

	OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration.Definitions
	.Add("ONION_HEAP_SIZE= (100ULL * 1024 * 1024)");
            	}

            	// ...
	}

### Xbox One

The MfMedia player plug-in is disabled by default and must be enabled in the project�s Plugin settings.
It is possible to compile and test the MfMedia plug-in on Windows 7 and up if the Engine is compiled against Windows 7 (by default we compile against Windows Vista). 

This can be accomplished by changing the following code in the `SetUpCompileEnvironment()` function in **UEBuildWindows.cs**:

	// Windows Vista or higher required	
	InBuildTarget.GlobalCompileEnvironment.Config.Definitions.Add("_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601");	
	InBuildTarget.GlobalCompileEnvironment.Config.Definitions.Add("WINVER=0x0601");

### Windows

The Windows Media Foundation (WMF) based player plug-in WmfMedia has a number of limitations for MP4 containers.

## Known Issues & Limitations

**Media Framework** is still considered experimental and there are some known issues and limitations which are outlined below. 

* **Android**
	* Audio currently plays via the OS and cannot be piped through UE4's Sound System. 
* **Audio**
	* There is currently no synchronization of audio samples, so playback may get out of sync. 
		*	Workaround: Use shorter clips where possible. 
	* Audio is currently always mixed down to 16-bit stereo 44.1 kHz, regardless of the input format. 
		*	Multi-channel audio support is being investigated and may arrive in future releases.
* **Editor**
	* The Playlist UI inside the Media Player only shows the currently opened Media Playlist asset. 
		*	Workaround: Edit the Playlist contents by **Double-clicking** on the MediaPlaylist asset to open its own editor. 
* **Playstation 4**
	* Playlists currently do not work.
* **Sequencer**
	* Media Playback will not render out properly when recording cinematics from Sequencer. 
		* We have this scheduled to release in the near future as we know this is important.
* **Windows**
	* The Media Player state machine is still in progress and may break if multiple control commands are issued simultaneously. 
		*	Workaround: Insert short delays between commands, so that the player has time to process them.
	* Some videos with multiple audio tracks fail to open.
	* QuickTime movie (.mov) support on Windows 7 and later is currently unreliable. 
		*	Workaround: This format is currently not recommended for use.
