If you are looking to have video playing inside your level on an object whether its a TV or a monitor or some other object, you can do so using the **Media Framework** assets. 
In this how-to we place a video file inside the **Content** folder of our project, then use the **Media Player** and related assets (with a little **Blueprint Visual Script**) to play the video during gameplay. 

[REGION:note]
For this how-to we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled.
You will also need a [Supported Video File](Engine\MediaFramework\TechReference) saved on our computer that you want to play. You can use your own or **Right-click** and download this [Sample Video](SampleVideo.mp4).

## Steps

1.	In the **Content Browser** expand the **Sources Panel**, then under **Content** create a folder called **Movies**.

1.	**Right-click** on the **Movies** folder and select **Show in Explorer**.

1.	Drag your video file into the **Content/Movies** folder of your project.

	Placing your video files inside the **Content/Movies** folder of your project will ensure the videos are properly packaged. 

1.	Inside Unreal Engine and your project, **Right-click** in the **Movies** folder and under **Media** select **File Media Source**. 

	![](FileMedia_03.png)

1.	Call the asset **SampleVideo**, then open it and point the **File Path** to the location of your video file in the **Content/Movies** folder. 

	![](FileMedia_04.png)

1.	**Right-click** in the **Content Browser** then under **Media** select the **Media Player** asset. 

	![](FileMedia_05.png)

1.	In the **Create Media Player** window, check **Audio output SoundWave asset** and **Video output Media Texture asset**. 

	![](FileMedia_06.png)

	This will automatically create a Sound Wave and Media Texture asset linked to this Media Player asset which is needed for playback. 

	![](FileMedia_07.png)

	We have called our Media Player asset **SampleMedia** which is also applied to the Sound Wave and Media Texture. 

	If you open the Media Player asset, you can **Double-click** on your Media Source asset and it will playback. 

	![](FileMedia_08.png)

	In the lower-right in the **Details** panel the **Output** section will also have auto-assigned the Sound Wave and Media Texture. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **StarterContent/Shapes** drag a **Shape_Plane** into the level. 

	![](FileMedia_09.png)

	We will use this Static Mesh to playback our video on. 

1.	Use the **Translate (W)**, **Rotation (E)** and **Scale (R)** tools to adjust the mesh similar to below. 

	![](FileMedia_10.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** then select both the **Sound Wave** and **Media Texture** assets and drop them on top of the **Static Mesh** in the level. 

	![](FileMedia_11.png)

	This will automatically create a **Material** and apply it to the Static Mesh. 

1.	From the Toolbar, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**. 

	![](FileMedia_12.png)

1.	Add a **Variable** of the **Media Player Reference** type called **Media Player** and set it to your **SampleMedia** Media Player asset. 

	![](FileMedia_13.png)

	You may need to **Compile** before you can assign the **Default Value**. 

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and drag in the **MediaPlayer** variable and also **Right-click** and add an **Event Begin Play** node. 

	![](FileMedia_14.png)

1.	Drag off the **MediaPlayer** variable and use the **Open Source** node set to your **SampleVideo** Media Source then connect as shown. 

	![](FileMedia_15.png)

1.	Close the Level Blueprint, then **Play** in the editor. 

	
## End Result

When you play in the editor, the video will start playing on the Static Mesh.

**Media Player** assets by default are set to **Play on Open** which is why the video automatically starts playing when calling the **Open Source** function.
There are additional commands you can issue to the Media Player asset such as pausing, rewinding or stopping the video once it has begun playing which can be found under the **Media Player** section when dragging off the Media Player Reference.
