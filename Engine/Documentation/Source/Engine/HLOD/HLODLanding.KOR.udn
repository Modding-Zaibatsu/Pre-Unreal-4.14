**Hierarchical Level of Detail** meshes (HLODs) have been developed as a way to increase performance and keep the quality bar high for projects using Unreal Engine 4.11 or later. HLODs can replace multiple static mesh actors with a group of static mesh actors at long view distances. This helps reduce the number of actors that need to be rendered for the scene, increasing performance by lowering the number of draw calls per frame. 

[REGION:warning]
HLOD doesn't currently work well with dynamic shadows (casting or recieving them), and as such, you should use static lighting and shadowing for the meshes that the HLOD system generates.
