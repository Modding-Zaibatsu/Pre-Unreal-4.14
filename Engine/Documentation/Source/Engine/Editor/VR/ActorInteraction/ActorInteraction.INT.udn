## Placing Actors in the World

In VR mode, you can place Actors in the world using the Content Browser or Place Mode.

**To place an Actor using the Content Browser:**

1. Aim one controller at the other to open the **Quick Select** menu.

1. Aim the free controller at **Content** and squeeze the **Trigger** to open the **Content Browser**.

1. Aim the controller at the asset you want to place an instance of and squeeze the **Trigger** to select it. In the example, we are selecting a barrel Static Mesh.

1. Move the controller to drag it from the Content Browser into the world, releasing the trigger to place the Actor in the world at that location.

**To place an Actor using Place Mode:**

1. Aim one controller at the other to open the **Quick Select** menu.

1. Aim the free controller at **Modes** and squeeze the **Trigger** to open the **Modes** panel. Place Mode is enabled by default.

1. In the **Place Mode** tab, select the type of Actor you want to add by pointing the Controller at it and squeezing the **Trigger** to select it. In the example, we are selecting a simple Cube.
