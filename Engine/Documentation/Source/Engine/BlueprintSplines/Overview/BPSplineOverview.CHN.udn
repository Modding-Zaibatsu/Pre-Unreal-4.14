At their core, **Blueprint Spline Components** are just a path for you to use for positional data. You can use it to move **Actors** (or other **Components**) around the world or place a series of **Actors** (or other **Components**) along the spline. They are fully editable in Blueprints with the ability to add/remove/duplicate Spline Points, change their tangent types, even animate them on tick. Further, they are also editable in the Level Editor with the capability to pass back those edits to their **Blueprint Construction Script**.

**Blueprint Spline Mesh Components** have a completely different use case. These deform a single **Static Mesh** along a two point spline. You cannot add more Spline Points to a Blueprint Spline Mesh Component, but the two points are completely controllable through Blueprints.

While their use cases are very different, they share the same procedures for adding them to a Blueprint, and editing tools.
