This how-to will step through editing **Blueprint Spline Component** curves while they are in the Level Editor. **Spline Mesh Components** can also be set so they can be edited in the Level Editor, but only have two points to use, and you cannot add any more points.

## Steps

1. Place Blueprint with a **Spline Component** into your Level.

1. Select Actor with Spline Component in your level. If you just placed it into the level, it will already be selected.

	If your Blueprint Actor has no other visible Components (Meshes, billboards, etc...) it may be difficult to select, however, you can always select it from the **World Outliner**.

	[REGION:note]
	If you are using a **Spline Mesh Component** you'll need to enable **Allow Spline Editing Per Instance** on the Blueprint in the Blueprint Editor to see its **Curve Points**.

1. Select a **Curve Point** on the spline, and using the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools, manipulate the Curve Points and Tangent Points into the desired shape.

	You can also use the following features to edit the curve:
	
	* To Add a point, right-click on a **Curve Section** and select **Add Spline Point Here**.
	* To Duplicate a point, right-click the **Curve Point** you want to duplicate and select **Duplicate Spline Point**
	* To Remove a point, right-click on a **Curve Point** and select **Delete Spline Point**
	
	For more information on all the tools available to edit Spline Components see [](Engine/BlueprintSplines/Reference/SplineEditorTool).
	
	[REGION:note]
	Once you start editing the Spline Component, the **Override Construction Script** property will be set to **True** to prevent it from overwriting your work.

## Result

While above, we are just editing a spline that doesn't affect anything, there are a number of uses for this data. See [](Resources/ContentExamples/Blueprint_Splines) documentation and the **Content Examples** project for additional information.
