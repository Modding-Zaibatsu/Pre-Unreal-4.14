Levels are binary assets, which can lead to some challenges when collaborating with teammates working on the same area of the project.

However, by setting up **Always Streaming** sublevels, multiple people can work in the same game "space" at the same time. For instance, you might have a sublevel that contains all 
the lights for your scene, as well as a sublevel that contains just the Static Meshes laying out your environment. Each sublevel can still only have one person working on it at a 
time, but with careful segmenting of your scene's Actors, you can minimize overlapping work areas. 

[REGION:tip]
You can even have sublevels' Level Blueprints communicate with each other, so that allows a switch in one sublevel, for instance, to toggle a light in another.

In the **Levels** window, just right-click on any Level you want to have always loaded and hover over **Change Streaming Method** in the context menu. Then, click on **Always Loaded**. 
The **Levels** window will also allow you to add more streaming Levels, move Actors between Levels, and change the debug color of Levels so you can visualize the setup more easily.

[REGION:note]
If your Levels are going to be always visible in game, make sure they are all toggled on in the **Levels** window before rebuilding lighting or navigation.
