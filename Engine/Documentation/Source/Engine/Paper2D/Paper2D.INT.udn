**Paper 2D** in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) is a sprite-based system for creating 2D and 2D/3D hybrid games entirely within the editor. At the core of Paper 2D are **Sprites** (which are a Texture Mapped Planar Mesh and associated Material). You can edit Sprites inside UE4 with the **Sprite Editor** and create sprite-based animations with **Flipbooks** (which animate a series of Sprites sequentially by using key frames and specifying a duration in frames to display them).
