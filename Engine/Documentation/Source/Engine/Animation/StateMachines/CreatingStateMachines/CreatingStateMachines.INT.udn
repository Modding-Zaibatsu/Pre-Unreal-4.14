Before actually creating your [**State Machine**](Engine\Animation\StateMachines\Overview), it is a good idea to take a little time and plan out exactly which states you will need, as well as the circumstances that will drive transitions between states. This will give you a solid plan of attack for not only the State Machine, but also the variables you will need to drive it and which animations will be a part of each state.

Creating State Machines is done within the AnimGraph of an Animation Blueprint. 

**Right-click** within the AnimGraph and choose **State Machines > New State Machine** from the context menu.

Generally, it is a good idea to name your State Machine immediately after creation. You can **Right-click** the new State Machine in the **My Blueprint** window and enter a new name in the name field. In this case, the State Machine has been named "Locomotion."

When first created, a State Machine is empty and may give a warning about this. 
You can open it to define its States and Transitions by **Double-clicking** it. This will open a new graph tab with nothing but an Entry point, which essentially kicks off the animation.

## Creating States and Conduits

Creating a new State is similar to creating new nodes within a Blueprint. You can either **Right-click** and create one out of the context menu, or you can drag a wire into an empty portion of the graph and release the mouse, which will also expose the context menu.

Once a new State has been created, it should immediately be named. This can be done immediately after creation by clicking on the name of the new State, or by **Right-clicking** the node in the graph, as well as within the **My Blueprint** panel.

Conduits are created in a similar manner, by either **Right-clicking** in the graph or dragging a new wire into an empty space on the graph.

## Creating Transition Rules

[**Transition Rules**](Engine\Animation\StateMachines\TransitionRules) are created automatically along the wires that connect States and Conduits. Graphically, Transition Rules appear as a small circular directional icon, like so:

This means that when you create a new State or Conduit by dragging a wire into an empty space on the graph, a Transition Rule will automatically be created for that wire. Additionally, you can drag a wire back to the original node to create a second Transition Rule for transitioning back to that node.
