The **Look At** Skeletal Control Node can be used to specify a Bone to trace or follow another Bone in the Skeleton.

Below, our character has two packs on their left side which use the **Look At** control node and are set to follow a foot bone.

Inside the viewport, a yellow debug line is a visulalization tool to help see which **Look at Bone** the **Bone to Modify** is following. 

[REGION:note]
You may need to enlarge the video to see the debug line or try it out in the editor.
