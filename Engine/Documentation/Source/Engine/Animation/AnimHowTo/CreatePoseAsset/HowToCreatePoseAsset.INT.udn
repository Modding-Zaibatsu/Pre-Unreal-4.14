Description:How to use Persona to generate a single frame Pose Asset.
version: 4.13
skilllevel: Intermediate

While you've been able to extract single frames of animation from an Animation Sequence for some time, you've been left to setup blends on your own. In 4.13, this changes with **Pose Assets**. These were implemented to support facial animation where either FACS (Facial Action Coding System) or viseme curves can drive poses. However, you could use this system to drive to create new animation by blending multiple poses. This supports bone transform as well as blendshapes. 

This How-To will walk you through the creation of a **Pose Asset**.

## Steps

1. From the Content Browser, you can right-click an **Animation Sequence** and create an **Pose Asset** from it:

1. Or, in Persona, you can use the **Create Asset** -> **Create PoseAsset** -> **From Current Pose** or **Animation** functions:

1. Once you create pose asset, the names will be auto generated by default. You can rename each pose or you can paste from clipboard.

1. You can then see the effect of each pose by changing their weights in the **FacePose** Panel.

## Result

You now have a new **Pose Asset** to use in your animations. To preview it make sure **Preview Post Asset** is set to your **Pose Asset**, and then add a **Variable Curve** to your animation that needs the **Pose Asset** data.

For these to work at run time, you'll also need **PoseAsset** node in your Anim Blueprint.
