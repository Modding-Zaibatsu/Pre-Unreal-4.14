Now that we have created our **Blend Space**, we need our [Animation Blueprint](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) to incorporate it. In this step, we alter the [State Machine](Engine/Animation/StateMachines) to include our Blend Space and hook up some variables that will be used to drive the parameter changes in the Blend Space for _Speed_ and _Direction_. 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser** under **Content/AnimStarterPack** open the **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint**.

1.	Inside the Animation Blueprint, click the **MyBlueprint** tab, then expand **AnimGraph** and **Double-click Locomotion**.

	This will open the State Machine used for this character which we will alter to use our created Blend Space.

	To see the process of setting up an Animation Blueprint from scratch for a character and incorporating character movement, please see the [](Gameplay/HowTo/CharacterMovement/Blueprints) guide.

1.	**Double-click** on the **Jog** state to open its graph.

1.	Click the **Asset Browser** tab, then drag the **Walk_Jog_BS** into the graph.

1.	Replace **BS_Jog** with the **Walk_Jog_BS** Blend Space and connect **Direction** and **Speed** and feed it into the **Result**.

	The _Speed_ and _Direction_ will now drive our Blend Space animations (these values are updated based on the characters movement).

	You can view this on the **Event Graph** of the Animation Blueprint. These values are being set by the Player Character's movement.

1.	Click **Compile** and **Save** then close the Animation Blueprint. 


## End Result

The Animation Blueprint is set up, however we need to provide a method of changing the _Speed_ and _Direction_ values inside our **Character Blueprint**. Once we do so, we will be able to blend smoothly between walking/jogging states.
