In this first step, we set up our [Blend Space](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) to move between several different animations based on values of two parameters. 


[REGION:note]
For this guide, we have created a new project using the **Blueprint Third Person** template with **Starter Content** enabled. 
We are also using animations that are included in the **Animation Starter Pack** which is available for download for free via the **Marketplace**. 
Once downloaded, add this pack to your project via the **Add to Project** button from the Launcher and proceed to the steps below.

## Steps

1.  In the **Content Browser** under **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints**, open the **ThirdPersonGameMode** Blueprint. 

1.	Under **Default Pawn Class**, click the dropdown menu and select the **Ue4ASP_Character**.

	This will set the default character pawn to use the one provided with the Animation Starter Pack. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1.	In the **Content Browser**, click the **Add New** Button then under **Animation**, select **Blend Space**.

1.	In the **Pick Skeleton** window, select the bottom **UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton**. 

	![](HowTo3.png)(w:540)

	This refers to the Skeletal Asset that came with the Animation Starter Pack. 

1.	Name the Blend Space **Walk_Jog_BS** (you can also move it to the **AnimStaterPack** folder if desired). 

	![](HowTo4.png)(w:720)

1.	Open the **Walk_Jog_BS**, then in the center window under the **Parameters** section, enter the values shown. 

	![](HowTo5.png)

	Set the **X Axis Label** to **Direction** and its range to **-180 to 180**. Set the **Y Axis Label** to **Speed** and its range to **150 to 270**. With the values set, click the **Apply Parameter Changes** button which will make the grid space to the left update with your values. Here we are defining the parameters that will determine the motion the Blend Space will produce based on the variables **Direction** and **Speed** (clamped by the range provided) which we will get from the player character. 

1.	From the **Asset Browser** window, drag the **Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation into the graph at the bottom center location. 

	![](HowTo6.png)

1.	Drag the **Walk_Lt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to position 1 and the **Walk_Rt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to position 2 below. 

	![](HowTo7.png)

1.	Drag the **Walk_Bwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to position 1 and 2 below. 

	![](HowTo8.png)

1.	Drag the **Jog_Fwd_Rifle** animation into the grid in the top center location. 

	![](HowTo9.png)

1.	Drag the **Jog_Lt_Rifle** animation to position 1 and the **Jog_Rt_Rifle** animation to position 2 below. 

	![](HowTo10.png)

1.	Drag the **Jog_Bwd_Rifle** animation to position 1 and 2 below.

	![](HowTo11.png)

	If you move your mouse around inside the grid, you will see the character start to blend between the different walk/jog animations. 

1.	Inside the **Anim Asset Details** window under Sample Interpolation, set **Target Weight Interpolation Speed Per Sec** to **4.0**. 

	![](HowTo12.png)

	This will smooth out the transition between the animations in the Blend Space to prevent popping from pose to pose. 

1.	Click **Save** to save your Blend Space setup.

You can now preview your Blend Space by moving your mouse inside the X/Y Grid. Moving near the lower end of the grid will cause the character to walk, while moving up near the top of the grid will cause the character to start to jog. If you are not seeing the character move, make sure that **Enable Preview BlendSpace** option is checked under the **Samples** section.
