So far we have set up our Blend Space and modified our Animation Blueprint to use that Blend Space, our last step involves providing a way for the player to adjust the parameters that drive our Blend Space inside our Animation Blueprint. The _Direction_ we will not need to worry about since it is determined based on the orientation of our character, however _Speed_ we need to provide a way to drive this value. 

## Steps

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/AnimStarterPack** open the **Ue4ASP_Character** Blueprint. 

1.	In the graph, find the **Crouching** section and **Right-click** and add a **C** Keyboard Event.

	This AnimBlueprint was built with the expectation that there is an **Action Mapping** called **Crouch** (which is why a warning appears). Since a Crouch Mapping does not exist in a fresh project, to get rid of the warning we will replace it with the **C** Key Event so that the player crouches when C is pressed. 

	[REGION:note]
	If you do not see a warning, you can use the exisiting Crouch Mapping instead of the C Key with the setup below.
	[/REGION]

1.	Drag off the **Pressed** pin and add a **FlipFlop** node, then connect the **A** and **B** pins as shown below.

	This will allow the player to C to enter/exit the crouched state instead of holding C to crouch. 

1.	Inside **MyBlueprint**, click the **Show Inherited Variables** box, then hold **Ctrl** and drag the **CharacterMovement** into the graph.

1.	Drag off the **CharacterMovement** node in the graph, search for and add the **Set Max Walk Speed** node and set it to **125**. 

1.	Duplicate the **Set Max Walk Speed** node and set the new node to **150**, then connect the nodes as shown below.

	Here we are setting the cap at which the character can move. The movement of the character is what determines the _Speed_ variable in our Animation Blueprint and Blend Space and causes the character to blend between the different animations for walking or jogging. 

1.	Below the Crouch section, **Right-click** in the graph and add the **Left Shift** Key Event. 

1.	Drag off the **Pressed** pin and add a **Branch** node, then also add a **Branch** of the **Released** pin. 

1.	For the **Condition** for both, **Right-click** search for and add **Get Crouch Button Down** and connect as shown. 

	![](Character6.png)

1.	Select, then duplicate the **CharacterMovement** and **Set Max Walk Speed** nodes from the Crouch section. 

1.	Connect off the **False** pins of each **Branch** as shown below and set the **Max Walk Speed** values to **270** and **150**. 

	![](Character7.png)

	In this example we are only allowing the player to sprint if they are not currently crouched. 

1.	In the **My Blueprint** panel select **Character Movement**. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for **Character Movement**, set **Max Walk Speed** to **150** and **Max Walk Speed Crouched** to **125**. 

	![](Character8.png)

	Here we are setting the default values for our character movement walk speed. 

1.	In the **Components** panel click the **Mesh**.

1.	In the **Details** make sure that the **AnimClass** is set to use **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint**. 

	![](Character10.png)

	If it is already set, do not worry. If it is not, be sure to set it so that the character uses the Animation Blueprint we've modified. 

1.	Click **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint.

1. In the Level Editor Viewport, delete the default character that is placed in the level. 

	![](Character9.png)

	Deleting this character will make sure that you spawn in using the Animation Starter Pack character when playing the game. 
	
1.	Click **Play** to play in the editor.

When playing in the Editor, using **WASD** to move around, the character will now walk by default and blend between walking animations when changing directions. If you press **C** to crouch, the character will now stay in a crouched position while walking at a slightly reduced speed than found when standing/walking. While standing, pressing and holding **Left Shift** while using WASD will cause the character to blend from the walk/aim animation to a lowered/aim jog animation, essentially creating a "sprint" for the character.
