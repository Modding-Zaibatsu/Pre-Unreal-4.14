[EXCERPT:Overview]
**Mesh** mode of the **Persona** animation editor (accessed by clicking the **Mesh** tab) shares some of the same windows that are available while in other Editing Modes, however there are two windows which are specific to **Mesh** mode (highlighted below): [Mesh Details](Engine/Animation/Persona\MeshDetails) and [Morph Target Previewer](Engine/Animation/Persona\MorphTargetPreviewer). 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

[/REGION]

##Mesh Details
The **Mesh Details** window allow you to modify properties pertaining to the mesh of the Skeletal Mesh such as **Material** and **Level of Detail (LOD)** settings, assigning **Apex Clothing**, adding meshes to the existing mesh, adjusting **Mirroring** settings or assigning a **Physics Asset** to the mesh. You can also **Reimport** asset data, adjust **Thumbnail Orbit** or **Texture Streaming** settings. 

###LOD Settings

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](LOD_Settings.png)
[/REGION]

In this section, you can assign Materials to aspects of the Skeletal Mesh and toggle whether or not those Materials cast shadows or not. 

In the **LOD Info** section, there are settings that allow you to modify how the LOD(s) function: 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Display Factor** | Indicates when to use the LOD. A smaller number means use the LOD when further away.|
| **LODHysteresis** | Used to avoid "flickering" when on LOD boundary. Only taken into account when moving from complex to simple. |
| **LODMaterial Map** | Specifies the mapping table from the LOD's materials to the USkeletalMesh materials array. |
| **Triangle Sorting** | Set the current triangle sorting method. |
| **Custom Left Right Axis** | Set the Left Right Axis.  |
| **Custom Left Right Bone Name** | Set the Left Right Bone name.  |

###Clothing

![](AddClothing.png)

This section of the **Mesh Details** allows you assign **Apex Cloth** assets to the mesh and view information about the assets assigned, there are also **Physics Properties** that can be adjusted for each asset assigned. 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Bend Resistance** | Bending stiffness of the cloth in the range [0,1]. |
| **Shear Resistance** | Shearing stiffness of the cloth in the range [0,1]. |
| **Stretch Limit** | Make cloth simulation less stretchy. A value smaller than 1 will turn it off. |
| **Friction** | Friction coefficient in the range [0,1]. |
| **Damping** | Spring damping of the cloth in range [0,1].  |
| **Drag** | Drag coefficient in the range [0,1].  |
| **Gravity Scale** | Amount of gravity that is applied to the cloth. |
| **Inertia Blend** | Amount of inertia that is kept when using local space simulation. Internal name is inertia scale. |
| **Self Collision Thickness** | Minimal amount of distance particles will keep of each other. |

###Additional Meshes

This section allows you to add meshes to the existing mesh or remove meshes that have been added. 

###Mesh

This section lists the Skeleton that is used with the Skeletal Mesh and its location inside the **Content Browser**. 

###Skeletal Mesh

![](SkeletalMeshSection.png)

The **Skeletal Mesh** section allows you to define Materials for any Material Interfaces that exist and whether or not to enable Shadow Casting from the Material. The ability to set whether or not to **Use Full Precision UVs** is available which if true, it will use 32 bit UVs and if false, it will use 16 bit UVs to save memory. 

<!--Commenting this section out as it no longer exists as of 4.9 Preview 4 
###Mirroring

![](MirroringSection.png)

There are two options available inside the **Mirroring** section that can be set: 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Skel Mirror Table** | This lists all the bones that should be mirrored. |
| **Skel Mirror Axis** | Set the Mirror Axis to X, Y, Z or None. |
| **Skel Mirror Flip Axis** | Set the Mirror Flip Axis to X, Y, Z or None. |-->

###Physics

In the **Physics** section, you can assign a Physics Asset to the mesh. The location of the asset in the **Content Browser** (if applicable) is also shown. 

###Reimport

![](ReimportSection.png)

This option allows you to reimport the asset being used and adjust the import settings (also shows the currently used import data and settings when applied).

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Update Skeleton Reference Pose** | If enabled, update the Skeleton (of the mesh being imported)'s reference pose. |
| **Use T0As Ref Pose** | Enable this option to use frame 0 as the reference pose.  |
| **Preserve Smoothing Groups** | If checked, triangles with non-matching smoothing groups will be physically split. |
| **Import Meshes in Bone Hierarchy** | If checked, meshes nested in bone hierarchies will be imported instead of being converted to bones.  |
| **Import Morph Targets** | If enabled, creates Unreal morph objects for the imported meshes. |
| **Import Mesh LODs** | If enabled, creates LOD models for Unreal meshes from LODs in the imported file; if not enabled, only the base mesh from the LOD group is imported. |
| **Normal Import Method** | Enabling this option will read the tangents (tangent, binormal, normal) from FBX files instead of generating them automatically.  |
| **Source File Path** | This is the path to the resource used to construct the Static Mesh. |
| **Source File Timestamp** | Date/Time-stamp of the file from the last import. |

###Thumbnail

![](ThumbnailSection.png)

The **Thumbnail** section allows you to set the **Orbit Pitch**, **Orbit Yaw** and **Orbit Zoom** of the camera around the asset.

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Orbit Pitch** | The pitch of the orbit camera around the asset. |
| **Orbit Yaw** | The yaw of the orbit camera around the asset. |
| **Orbit Zoom** | The offset from the bounds sphere distance from the asset. |

###Texture Streaming

![](TextureStreamingSection.png)

**Texture Streaming** allows artists to adjust the distance where textures using UV 0 are streamed in/out.

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Streaming Distance Multiplier** | 1.0 is the default, where a higher value increases the streamed-in resolution. |
