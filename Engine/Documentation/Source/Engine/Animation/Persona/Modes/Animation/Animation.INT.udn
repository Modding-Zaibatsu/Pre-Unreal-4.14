The **Animation** mode of **Persona** (accessed by selecting the **Animation** tab from the toolbar window) contains several windows which appear in other modes, however the three windows (denoted above) are the ones used most when working in Animation mode. 

1. [Anim Asset Details](Engine\Animation\Persona\AnimAssetDetails) - The **Anim Asset Details** panel is a context-sensitive property editor that allows you to change settings on various animation assets, such as Anim Sequences, Blend Spaces, Anim Montages, and so on. By default, the **Anim Asset Details** panel is only visible when Persona is in **Animation** mode.
1. [Anim Sequence Editor](Engine\Animation\Sequences\Editor) - The **Animation Sequence Editor** provides functionality for previewing and editing individual AnimationSequence assets. The properties, including compression scheme, of the AnimationSequence can be set, and animation notification events - also called Notifies - can be added to allow camera effects, particle effects, sounds, and more to be triggered based on the animation.
1. [Asset Browser](Engine\Animation\Persona\AssetBrowser) - The **Asset Browser** panel displays the AnimSequences, BlendSpaces, AnimMontages, and AimOffsetBlendSpaces that are valid for the target Skeleton in a mini **Content Browser**-style interface.
