The **Debug** panel shows information designated as important by the designer in the form of breakpoints and watch values as well as a trace stack of all nodes belonging to the Blueprint that have been executed. This window also shows controls for controlling execution of the game when using breakpoints.

The Debug panel in persona is the same panel as found in the Blueprint Editor. To learn more about using this panel, see the [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Debugging) page.
