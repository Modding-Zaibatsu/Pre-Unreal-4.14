[EXCERPT:Intro]
Blend Spaces are used by placing nodes in the **AnimGraphs** of Animation Blueprints. These nodes take in value data that is used to drive which animations the Blend Space uses to create the final blended pose.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

## Adding Blend Space Nodes

Blend Space nodes provide access to the sample parameter data and output pose of the Blend Space.
 
To place a Blend Space node using drag and drop:

1. In **Persona**, find the Blend Space you want to sample in the **Asset Browser**.

1. **Left-click** on it and drag the mouse into the **AnimGraph**.

1. Release the **Left Mouse Button** to place the Blend Space node.

**To place a Blend Space node using the context menu:**

1. **Right-click** in the **AnimGraph** and expand **Animation** to see a list of all compatible Blend Spaces.

1. Click on the Blend Space you want to sample.

1. The Blend Space node is placed.

## Inputting Data

Blend Spaces rely on data being passed into the sample parameters in order to perform the animation blending. Each Blend Space node has input data pins for each sample parameter. Variables or outputs from other nodes can be wired to these pins to pass the necessary data to the Blend Space.

[REGION:note]
Since Blend Space editing is currently limited to using two inputs, the third input pin is not used.

The values passed to the Blend Space are generally variables calculated during the update cycle in the **EventGraph** or through gameplay code. An example of the Direction and Speed variables being calculated in the **EventGraph** of an Animation Blueprint is shown below.

## Output Pose

The **Pose** output pin of the Blend Space node can be wired to the **Pose** input pin of the **Result** node in the **AnimGraph** in the simplest case.

Or, it can be wired to any other input pin that accepts an animation pose as an input when a more complex animation chain is necessary.
