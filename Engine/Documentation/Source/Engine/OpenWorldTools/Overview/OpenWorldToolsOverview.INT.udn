<!--## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Procedural Foliage tools in your project, you must first enable them by going to the **Main Toolbar** and then going to **Edit** > **Editor Preferences** > **Experimental**. 
Once you are in the Experimental section enable Procedural Foliage option by clicking on the checkmark box next to the word **Procedural Foliage**.

You will also need to download the **Open World Demo Collection** content pack from the Unreal Engine 4 Launcher as some of the content from the collection will be used in the Open World Tools Quick Starts.

Once the Open World Demo Collection is downloaded add it to the project that you are using to follow along with this Quick Start by first locating the Open World Demo Collection in the UE4 Launcher **Vault** section and then click on the button that says **Add to Project**. You will then be shown a list of projects that you can add this to. Select the project that you are using to follow along with this Quick Start and then press the **Add to Project** button to add the content. When you re-open the project you will now see a folder called **Kite Demo** and inside this folder you will find the content you need.

## Types of Tools 
The Open World Tools in Unreal Engine 4 allow you to place Static Meshes inside your levels using a computer algorithm to determine placement instead having to do this work manually. 
This enables you to quickly generate a natural looking forest comprised of many different species of trees, plants and bushes.

When talking about the Open World tools we are actually referring to the two different tool sets inside of UE4. 
The tool set that you use depends on what you want to accomplish. 
For example if you want to make an expansive pine and birch tree forest then you're going to want to use the **Procedural Foliage Tool**. 
If you want to densely populate the Landscape Terrain used in that forest with grass, flowers, and small rocks, then you would use the **Grass Tool**.

### Procedural Foliage Tool 
The Procedural Foliage Tool is used for simulating huge forests that are filled with lots of different kinds of trees and bushes. 
This tool works by simulating how a forest grows over the years using **Steps** to define years of growth. 
At each Step in the simulation new virtual seeds are cast into the level to act as spawn locations for other Foliage Type Actors. 
By tweaking the various Foliage Type options like **Spread**, **Size**, and **Priority Settings**, you will affect how those Foliage Types spread and compete for spawn locations through the level the Procedural Foliage Spawner in placed in.
To learn more about how to use the Procedural Foliage Tool check out the Procedural Foliage Quick Start.

#### Foliage Type Actors
The Procedural Foliage Tools make use of Actors called **Foliage Types**. 
Foliage Types allow you to define various properties the Foliage should have like what Static Mesh to use or how big Static Mesh should be spawned.
The chart below gives a very high level explanation of the four main sets of properties that the Foliage Type Actor is broken down into and what those options do.

| Property Name| Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
|**Mesh**| The Mesh section is where you define which Static Mesh to use for the foliage.|
|**Placement**| The Placement section is where you can adjust how the Static Meshes specified in the Mesh section are placed on objects throughout the level.|
|**Growth**| The Growth section helps define how big the trees will be at the beginning of the simulation and how big they will "Grow" by the end of the simulation.|
|**Instance Settings**| The Instance Settings allows you to adjust how the Static Mesh used for the Foliage Type will be displayed in the level.|

### Grass Tool
[region:note]
Currently the Grass Tool will only work in conjunction with the Landscape Terrain system. 
[/region]
The Grass Tool is used to densely cover the Landscape Terrain with things like grass, flowers, and small rocks. 
You can use the Grass Tool to define a Static Mesh that will spawn when a certain Landscape Layer is painted on the Landscape Terrain. 
This tool does not use any kind of simulation like the Procedural Foliage Spawner does. Instead, it simply fills the specified area at the specified density with the specified Static Mesh. 
To learn more about how to use the Grass Tool, check out the Grass Tool Quick Start that is linked below.

#### Grass Type Actors
The Grass Tool makes use of Actors called **Landscape Grass Types**.
Landscape Grass Types allow you to define various properties the Grass should have like what Static Mesh to use for the grass and how many of those Static Meshes should be spawned.
The chart below gives a very high level explanation of the main sets of properties that the Landscape Grass Type Actor is broken down into and what those options do.

|**Grass Varieties**| Inside of Grass Varieties you can specify what type of Static Mesh to use for the grass as well as grass density and cull distance settings.|
