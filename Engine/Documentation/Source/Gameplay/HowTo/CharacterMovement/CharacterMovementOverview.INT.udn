To create **Character Movement**, several parts are needed, each working together to produce the end result of a character moving around in your game. You will need a character, inputs for that character, how the character responds to inputs from a player, animations for the character moving, transitions to and from animations, and the logic behind the transitioning between animations. 

In this "How To" series, we intend to show you how you can set all this up from scratch in Blueprints where at the end of the series, you will have a playable character that exhibits different forms of Character Movement.
