For this series, we are using the **Animation Starter Pack**, which is available for free on the **Marketplace**, as it contains several animations that can be used to create character movement. Once you have downloaded the Animation Pack, you can add the pack to an existing project (preferably a New Blank Project) via the **Add to project** button in the Launcher then specifying which project you want to add the assets to.
