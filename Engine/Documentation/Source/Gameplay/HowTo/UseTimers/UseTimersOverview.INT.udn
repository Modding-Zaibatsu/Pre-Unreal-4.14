**Timers** in Unreal Engine 4 are a useful tool that can be used to perform an action once (or repeatedly) at specified intervals. Timers can be used to set actions to happen on a delay or over a period of time. For example, you may want to make the player invincible after obtaining a certain item and then revert after 10 seconds. Or, you may want to apply damage every second to a player that is standing in fire. Each of these scenarios can be accomplished with the use of Timers.
