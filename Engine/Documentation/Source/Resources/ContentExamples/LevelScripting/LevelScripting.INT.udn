Welcome to the **Level Scripting** example level!


[INCLUDE:Resources\ContentExamples\ExampleLevelOverview#ExampleLevel]

This Content Example focuses on the use of Level Scripting as a means to create gameplay for your game levels. This is very similar to the creation of [Blueprint Classes](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Types\ClassBlueprint), but remains different in that level scripting will _always_ be native to the level for which it was created. This means that your level scripts are not placeable assets in and of themselves, where Class Blueprints _are_ placeable assets.

You can [open the Level Blueprint](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Types\LevelBlueprint) to see all the level scripting set up for this Content Example.
