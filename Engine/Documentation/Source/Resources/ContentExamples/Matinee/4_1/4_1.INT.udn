Earlier we (Key Types) we learned about the presets but Curves can be edited. On every Track there is a little grey box with zigzag line. Clicking it (yellow) will display the Track in the Curve editor window.

In the Curve editor every axis is displayed as a Curve. Every axis visibility can be set with the colored squares to the left. The Yellow box Toggles the visibility of all axis.  All changes to curve can be seen directly in the viewport Trajectories (yellow path) also changing the tangents of a Key can be done in the viewports. 

The Curve editor has its own toolbar with presets and auto view aligns.
