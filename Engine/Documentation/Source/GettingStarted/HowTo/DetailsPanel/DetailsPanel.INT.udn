Once you place an [Actor](Engine/Actors) in your level, you may want to modify the way it looks or functions in your level. With the Actor selected in the level, inside the [Details](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details) panel you will find information about the Actor that can be modified. This How to will show you some sample use cases for accessing the Details panel and modifying an Actor's properties.

Over the course of this guide we will change several properties that will affect an Actor in our level such as scaling the Actor to increase its size, applying a Material, turning on Physics for the Actor, as well as tweaking Collision Settings so that it registers when it hits other Actors during gameplay.
