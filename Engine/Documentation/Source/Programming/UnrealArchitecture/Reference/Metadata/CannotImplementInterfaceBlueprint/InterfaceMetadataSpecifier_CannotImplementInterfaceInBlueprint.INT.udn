Description:
Availability:Public
Version: 4.9

This interface cannot be implemented by a **Blueprint** (e.g., it has only non-exposed C++ member methods).

Any interfaces that define a function that isn't a [BlueprintImplementableEvent](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions/Specifiers/BlueprintImplementableEvent) or [BlueprintNativeEvent](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions/Specifiers/BlueprintNativeEvent) must be declared as `CannotImplementInterfaceInBlueprint`.

## Usage

    UINTERFACE(meta=(CannotImplementInterfaceInBlueprint))
    class ClassName : UInterface
    {
        GENERATED_UINTERFACE_BODY()
    };
