Description:
Availability:Public
Version: 4.9

Indicates that this class is allowed to store data in a configuration file (`.ini`). If there are any configurable variables in the class (declared with the `config` or `globalconfig` variable specifiers), this specifier causes those variables to be stored in the specified configuration file inside the *(* and *)*. This flag is propagated to all child classes and cannot be negated, but child classes can change the `.ini` file by re-declaring the `config` keyword and specifying a different file name. The value of *IniName* is appended to the game name - minus the "Game" part - to specify the name of the `.ini` file to store data in (for instance, in UDKGame specifying `config(Camera)` will cause the class to use the `UDKCamera.ini` file). The keyword inherit can also be specified as the *IniName*, which will cause the class to use the same config file as its parent. Some `.ini` files exist by default, such as:

* `Config=Engine`: Uses the **Engine** configuration file, which is the name of your game followed by `Engine.ini`. For example, UDKGame's engine configuration file is named `UDKEngine.ini`. 
* `Config=Editor`: Uses the **Editor** configuration file, which is the name of your game followed by `Editor.ini`. For example, UDKGame's editor configuration file is named `UDKEditor.ini`. 
* `Config=Game`: Uses the **Game** configuration file, which is the name of your game followed by `Game.ini`. For example, UDKGame's game configuration file is named `UDKGame.ini`. 
* `Config=Input`: Uses the **Input** configuration file, which is the name of your game followed by `Input.ini`. For example, UDKGame's engine configuration file is named `UDKInput.ini`.
