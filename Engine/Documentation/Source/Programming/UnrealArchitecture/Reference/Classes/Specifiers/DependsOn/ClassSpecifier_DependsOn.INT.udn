Description:
Availability:Public
Version: 4.9

Indicates that *ClassName* is compiled before this class. *ClassName* must specify a class in the same (or a previous) package. Multiple dependency classes can be specified using a single `DependsOn` line delimited by commas, or can be specified using a separate `DependsOn` line for each class. This is important when a class uses a struct or enum declared in another class as the compiler only knows what is in the classes it has already compiled.

DependsOn=(ClassName, Classname, ...)
