Description: 
Availability:Public
Version: 4.9

 Only useful for struct properties. Retry replication of this property if it fails to be fully sent (e.g. object references not yet available to serialize over the network). For simple references, this is the default, but for structs, this is often undesirable due to the bandwidth cost, so it is disabled unless this flag is specified.
