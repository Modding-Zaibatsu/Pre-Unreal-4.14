Description:Configuring Unreal Build System to control how the engine is built.
Version: 4.14

UnrealBuildTool reads settings from XML configuration files in the following locations:

    * Engine/Programs/NotForLicensees/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml
	* Engine/Saved/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml
	* *User Folder/AppData*/Roaming/Unreal Engine/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml
	* *My Documents*/Unreal Engine/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml

The default settings are written to Engine/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml as a reference. This file is generated whenever UnrealBuildTool runs; any settings you change here will be overwritten.

## UnrealBuldTool Configuration Properties

$ bStopXGECompilationAfterErrors : If true, compilation with XGE will stop when an error occurs.
    * Continuing compiling makes subsequent compiles much faster after you fix the odd error.
    * It lets you see compile errors in all files before quitting the build.
    * You can use **Ctrl + Break** to interrupt a failed build.
$ bOmitPCDebugInfoInDevelopment : If true, debug info is not included when building in Development configuration.
    * Set to false to always include debug info.
    * Including debug info slows down compiling, but gives you line numbers and stack info in Development builds.
$ bUseUnityBuild : Set to true when rebuilding the engine as a whole. This should be disabled when using fast iteration mode.
$ bEnableFastIteration : If true, compile and link times are dramatically decreased. This should be disabled when creating unity builds.
    * Setting to _true_ gives fastest iteration times.
    * If you encounter weird "RPC" or "PDB" link errors, then you should set `bUseIncrementalLinking = false` in `ValidateConfiguration()`
