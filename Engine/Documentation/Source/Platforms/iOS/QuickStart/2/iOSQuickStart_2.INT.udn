This step is not necessary at this point, but it is always good to have a project ready to test deploy. [You can skip this section if you already have a project prepared.](Platforms/iOS/QuickStart/3)

The first step in beginning development of any game is to create a [project](Engine/Basics/Projects), which you will 
ultimately launch or install on your iOS device.

1. From the **New Project**, create a new project for your game:

[REGION:warning]
The PC-only workflow described in this guide requires a pure Blueprint project. If you wish to use code in your 
project, you will also need a Mac in order to compile the code. You can follow the workflow outlined on the 
[](Platforms/iOS/GettingStarted) page to develop code-based projects for iOS on a PC.
