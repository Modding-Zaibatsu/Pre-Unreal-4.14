In order for your Gear VR project to be accepted to the Oculus store there are certain requirements that your project must adhere to. 
One of these requirements is that at any point while someone is using your project they need to be able to access the Gear VR Global Menu when they hold down the back button for more than 0.75 seconds. 
In the following Quick Start we will cover everything you need to know so the user can enable the Gear VR Global menu in your projects.

[region:note]
Please note that the following Quick Start will work on any project that is setup for Gear VR. 
If you have not done so already please make sure to check out the Gear [VR Quick Start](Platforms\GearVR\QuickStart) for detailed information on how to get a project up and running with Gear VR.
