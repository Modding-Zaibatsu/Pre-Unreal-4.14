The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) **Mobile Packaging Wizard** will help to reduce the size of your mobile project by packaging only the content that is needed to upload your project to the App store.  The rest of the content will be download from the cloud when the user launches the game on their device for the first time. In the following document, we will take a look at how you set up your UE4 mobile project to use the Mobile Packaging Wizard.


## Mobile Packaging Wizard Tool Location

To access the Mobile Packaging Wizard you will need to do the folowing.

1. From the **Main Toolbar**, locate the **Window** option and click on it.

## Setting Up a Mobile Packaging Wizard Profile

Before the Mobile Packaging Wizard can be used, a new profile that is specific to your project's needs has to be created. In the following section, we will take a look at what needs to be done in order to create a custom launch profile for your UE4 mobile project.

1. Click on the small white triangle next to **Custom Launch Profiles**, selecting the **Minimal Android APK + DLC…** option from the list.

	While we are using Android for this example, the workflow will still be the same when using the Mobile Packaging Wizard for a game that is meant for IOS.

	[region:note]
	Only the contents referenced by the map(s) you choose will be packaged into the application for upload to the Play Store. Typically, you should choose only a single map that contains a Level Blueprint to kick off the **BuildPatchServices** code with a **UMG** user interface to show the download progress (showing any applicable error conditions).

1. In the **Downloadable Content** menu, select the Android texture formats your application will support with the maps that will need to be downloaded. When that has been completed, press the **Create Profile** button to create a new Custom Launch Profile.

## Building the Application 

Now that all of the options for the Mobile Packing Wizard have been set up and saved into a Custom Launch Profile, it is time to run that profile and package your project. In the following section, we will take a look at what needs to be done in order for the Mobile Packing Wizard to successfully package your UE4 project.

1. If the Project Launcher is not already open, open it up and then look at the bottom of the Project Launcher in the **Custom Launch Profile** section. In this section, you should have two profiles that start with your project name and are followed by either **Android APK** or **Android DLC**.

	[region:note]
	When you first open up the Project Launcher, the Custom Launch Profiles section could have a few items in it by default. To remove these items, right-click on the item you want to remove, and then select the **Delete** option to remove it.
	[/region]

1. Locate the **APK** Profile option and then click on the **Launch this Profile** button to begin the packaging process.

	[region:warning]
	You must package your project's files before you build the DLC. <!--Trying to package the DLC first and then packing your project will not.-->
	[/region]

1. Once the **Launch this Profile** button has been pressed, the Project Launcher will begin the packaging process. You can see the progress of the packaging process in the Project Launcher window.

## Building the DLC

Once your project has finished the cooking process for the initial download from the App store, it is now time to cook the content that is to be downloaded from the cloud after your App has been installed to a mobile device. 

1. From the Project Launcher, go to the **Custom Launch Profiles** section and look for your project's **DLC** option. When the DLC option for your project has been located, click on the **Launch this Profile** button to begin the DLC packaging process.
