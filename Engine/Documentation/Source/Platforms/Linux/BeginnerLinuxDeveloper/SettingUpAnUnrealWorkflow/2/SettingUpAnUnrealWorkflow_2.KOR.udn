%Steps%

Now that you've setup Git on your Linux machine, you're ready to download the Unreal Engine source code from our [GitHub site](http://github.com/EpicGames). There 
are a couple of ways to download the UE4 source code, one way is to use the download feature on our GitHub page and the other way is to fork and clone the Unreal 
Engine repository with your Git client. We'll cover both ways on this page.

## Downloading from GitHub

If don't want to fork and clone the Unreal Engine repository using Git, you can use the **Download ZIP** button on our [GitHub site](http://github.com/EpicGames).

1.	First, select the branch you want to download by clicking the **Branch:** button on the left side of the page.
