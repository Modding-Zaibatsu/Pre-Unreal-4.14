	When SteamVR shows all devices in green like in the image above that means everything is working correctly. 
	If a device that shows up in grey then there  is a problem with that device.
	SteamVR will tell you what is wrong with a greyed out device and possible fixes if you hover your mouse over the greyed out device.
