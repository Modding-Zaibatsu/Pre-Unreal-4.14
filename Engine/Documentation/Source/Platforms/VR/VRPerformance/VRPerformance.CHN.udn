## VR Performance Overview
Trying to figure out which computer parts are capable of producing the breathtaking imagery and immersive experiences that Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Displays (HMD's) 
like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive produce can be a daunting and somewhat frustrating experience due to the many hardware choices available. 
To help alleviate this frustration and ensure that any personal computer (PC) hardware that anyone is planning to purchase will meet the demanding rendering requirements of a UE4 powered VR experience, the following document has been put together.
Inside of this  document, you will find detailed information about what PC hardware is recommended for VR development with UE4 and what type of performance you should expect to see on such hardware. 
You will also find performance tracking data that tracks how different version of UE4 perform with different different HMD's and PC hardware.

## Recommended PC Hardware for VR & UE4

Due to the demanding rendering requirements of VR, the PC that is used to run a VR experience needs to have certain hardware inside of it to give users a smooth VR experience as possible. 
According to [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/powering-the-rift/), for your PC to be able to run the smoothest VR experience as possible, the hardware inside of that PC needs to meet or exceed the following requirements.

* **CPU:** Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater.
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD 290 equivalent or greater.
* **RAM:** 8 GB of RAM or more.
* **Opperating System:** Windows 7 SP1 or newer.
* **USB Ports:** At least 2x USB 3.0 ports or more.
* **HDMI Output:** HDMI 1.3 video output supporting a 297MHz clock via a direct output architecture.

Taking the recommended hardware spec's from Oculus into consideration the following computer parts list was generated. 
The computer parts that you will find in the list below were picked based on how well the part in question met the following criteria. 

* How closely the part matched the recommend hardware specifications set forth by Oculus.
* Number of positive customer reviews the part had. 
* What the price of the part was.

[region:note]
Please note that while it might be possible to run VR experiences on hardware that does not meet the following specifications, it is not advisable as it could result in a poor VR experiance.
