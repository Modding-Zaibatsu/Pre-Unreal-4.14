Epic Games has established the Integrated Partners Program (IPP) for the purposes of having a formal business relationship with selected companies making cross-platform technologies which integrate with, and are complementary to, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Under the IPP program, Epic provides continuous UE4 source code access and full technical support to IPP members. Companies who join the IPP agree to provide a high level of technical support for UE4 licensees through Epic's established support channels, keep their implementations up-to-date with the latest UE4 versions, and work with Epic on potential promotional and co-marketing efforts. The IPP program will make it easier for Unreal Engine 4 licensees to incorporate 3rd party middleware solutions from IPP vendors into their games.

These products are in addition to the tools and software listed on the [Third Party Software](Support/BusinessAndLegal/ThirdPartySoftware) page.

If you are interested in integrating a product, it is best to contact the vendor. 

## Logos and Trademarks

Integrated Partner Program logos are available for placement on partners' websites, product packaging, or other media. Only the official logos should be used and all usage must be in accordance with the usage guidelines stipulated by Epic Games.
