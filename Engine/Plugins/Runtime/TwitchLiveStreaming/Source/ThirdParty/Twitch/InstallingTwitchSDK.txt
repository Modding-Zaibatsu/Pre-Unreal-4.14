SETTING UP THE TWITCH SDK WITH UNREAL ENGINE
============================================


The Twitch SDK is currently not included with Unreal Engine by default.  This means that the 
TwitchLiveStreaming plugin will not be able to function, and Twitch features will not be available 
in the game or editor.

To use Twitch in your game, you'll need to contact Twitch and obtain a copy of the SDK along with permission
to use it in your product.  We're currently using SDK version 6.21, so you'll want to get that version.
After downloading the SDK, you can follow the instructions below to set it up with UE4.  Make sure to read 
over Twitch's license as well as the Twitch SDK integration guide they will provide.  

To install the SDK:

	- Acquire the Twitch C++ SDK.  You'll need to contact Twitch to get access.
		- Make sure you pull down the correct version of the SDK. (6.21)
		- Also remember to read the Twitch SDK license agreement.

	- Unzip the SDK to the /Engine/Plugins/Runtime/TwitchLiveStreaming/Source/ThirdParty/Twitch/Twitch-6.21/ folder (create the folder if it is missing)

	- Copy the precompiled binary files in the Twitch SDK "lib" folder to a the /Engine/Plugins/Runtime/TwitchLiveStreaming/Binaries/ThirdParty/Twitch/Twitch-6.21/Win64 (or Win32) folder (create the folder if it is missing)

	- Recompile the engine.  The TwitchLiveStreaming plugin will see the SDK files, and activate support for Twitch broadcasting in the game and editor.
	
	- See the Unreal Engine manual for more about using the built-in Twitch integration for broadcasting your game or editor sessions
	

That's it!  Have fun!
