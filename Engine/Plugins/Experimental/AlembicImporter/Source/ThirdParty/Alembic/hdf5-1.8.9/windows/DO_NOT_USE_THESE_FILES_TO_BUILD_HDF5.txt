Building HDF5 from the Visual Studio solutions and projects included in
the windows\ folder is no longer the preferred way to build HDF5!

CMake is now the preferred way to construct appropriate Windows projects
and solutions for each version of Visual Studio. 

CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/

Instructions for building and testing HDF5 using CMake can be found in
the CMake.txt file in the release_docs\ folder.

The files in the windows\ folder are for the small number of users who
require them and will be removed HDF5 1.10.
