3. Definitions
The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and “distribution” have the same meaning here as under U.S.  copyright law.
A “contribution” is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.
A “contributor” is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.
“Licensed patents” are a contributor’s patent claims that read directly on its contribution.

J. Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.

8. 8.The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it.  The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.
