/**
 * Interface for message senders.
 *
 * Classes that implement this interface are able to send messages on a message bus. Each message sender must be uniquely
 * identifiable with a message address that is returned by the ISendMessages.GetSenderAddress method. It is recommended
 * that implementors of this interface generate a GUID for each instance, which must not change throughout the lifetime of
 * the instance.
 *
 * The sending of messages is accomplished with the IMessageBus.Forward, IMessageBus.Publish and IMessageBus.Send methods.
 * In case an error occurs during the sending of a message, the ISendMessages.NotifyMessageError method will be called.
 *
 * This interface provides a rather low-level mechanism for receiving messages. Instead of implementing it, Most users will
 * want to use an instance of FMessageEndpoint, which provides a much more convenient way of sending and receiving messages.
 *
 * @see FMessageEndpoint, IMessageBus, IReceiveMessages
