	/**
	 * Macro for marking up deprecated code, functions and types.
	 *
	 * Features that are marked as deprecated are scheduled to be removed from the code base
	 * in a future release. If you are using a deprecated feature in your code, you should
	 * replace it before upgrading to the next release. See the Upgrade Notes in the release
	 * notes for the release in which the feature was marked deprecated.
	 *
	 * Sample usage (note the slightly different syntax for classes and structures):
	 *
	 *		DEPRECATED(4.6, "Message")
	 *		void Function();
	 *
	 *		struct DEPRECATED(4.6, "Message") MODULE_API MyStruct
	 *		{
	 *			// StructImplementation
	 *		};
	 *		class DEPRECATED(4.6, "Message") MODULE_API MyClass
	 *		{
	 *			// ClassImplementation
	 *		};
	 *
	 * @param VERSION The release number in which the feature was marked deprecated.
	 * @param MESSAGE A message containing upgrade notes.

// Make certain warnings always be warnings, even despite -Werror.
// Rationale: we don't want to suppress those as there are plans to address them (e.g. UE-12341), but breaking builds due to these warnings is very expensive
// since they cannot be caught by all compilers that we support. They are deemed to be relatively safe to be ignored, at least until all SDKs/toolchains start supporting them.
