	/**
	 * Starts broadcasting the game's video (and optionally audio) using an internet streaming service, if one is available 
	 *
	 * @param	FrameRate					Frame rate to stream video from when broadcasting to services like Twitch.
	 * @param	ScreenScaling				How much to scale the broadcast video resolution down to reduce streaming bandwidth.  We recommend broadcasting at resolutions of 1280x720 or lower.  Some live streaming providers will not be able to transcode your video to a lower resolution, so using a high resolution stream may prevent low-bandwidth users from having a good viewing experience.
	 * @param	bStartWebCam				Starts your web camera right away.  When the web camera is active, video from your web camera will be captured and displayed while broadcasting, so that your viewers can see your presence.
	 * @param	DesiredWebCamWidth			Desired web cam capture resolution width.  The web cam may only support a limited number of resolutions, so we'll choose one that matches as closely to this as possible
	 * @param	DesiredWebCamHeight			Desired web cam capture resolution height.
	 * @param	bMirrorWebCamImage			You can enable this to flip the web camera image horizontally, so that it looks like a mirror
	 * @param	bDrawSimpleWebCamVideo		If enabled, the engine will draw a simple web cam image on top of the game viewport.  If you turn this off, it's up to you to draw the web cam image yourself.  You can access the web cam texture by calling IGameLiveStreaming::Get().GetWebCamTexture().
	 * @param	bCaptureAudioFromComputer	Enables broadcast of audio being played by your computer, such as in-game sounds
	 * @param	bCaptureAudioFromMicrophone	Enables broadcast of audio from your default microphone recording device
	 * @param	CoverUpImage				Optional image to broadcast, instead of what you're looking at on screen.  This is useful if you don't want to publicly share the visuals on screen.
