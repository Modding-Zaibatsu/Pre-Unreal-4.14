			A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one
			or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a
			line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal
			paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.
		</p>

		<p>
			The implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule is that
			Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differs significantly
			from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type’s “Convert Line
			Breaks” option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into
			a &lt;br /&gt; tag.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you do want to insert a &lt;br /&gt; break tag using Markdown, you end a line
		    with two or more spaces, then type return.
		</p>

	        Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a &lt;br /&gt;, but a simplistic “every
	        line break is a &lt;br /&gt;” rule wouldn’t work for Markdown. Markdown’s email-style
	        blockquoting and multi-paragraph list items work best — and look better — when
	        you format them with hard breaks.
